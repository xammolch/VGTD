		<p>My primary interest is programming. I have loved it for years, and I will continue to further my skills in it. Video games are another passion of mine, as I have always enjoyed them. My favourite genres of video games are FPS, first person shooter, games, games based on building, and single player games. I also enjoy mountain biking, and spending time with those I care about.
