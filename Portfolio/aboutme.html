		<p>My name is Maxim Molchanov. I am 19 years of age, and a student of Eastern Collegeâ€™s Moncton campus. I graduated from Nackawic Senior High School in June 2018. I was born in Moscow, Russia, and I moved to Vancouver, British Columbia as a child. I am currently living in Moncton, New Brunswick. I am new to the Moncton area. I can program in the C and HTML coding languages, however, I would say that I need a refresher on C. I have a small, 5 year old dog named Dosya.</p>
