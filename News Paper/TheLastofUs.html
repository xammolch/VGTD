		<p>Sony announced The Last of Us Part II today, a sequel to Naughty Dog's 2013 post-apocalyptic shooter.
Revealed at PlayStation Experience 2016, The Last of Us Part II trailer showcased an older Ellie from the original game playing guitar, as well as the return of Joel. Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann wrote in a post on the PlayStation Blog that more information on the game will arrive in the coming months, though its release is<q>a ways off.</q> Druckmann didn't offer further story details but explained that the studio spent <q>years on different ideas and almost gave up, but we finally uncovered a story that felt special.</q>
A panel later in the day also shed some light in the sequel, including Ellie's starring role and how Part II complements the original game.
Naughty Dog released The Last of Us on the PlayStation 3 in 2013, with a remastered version of the game later launching on PS4 in 2014. Telling the story of Joel (Troy Baker) and Ellie (Ashley Johnson) in a world where humans fight for survival amid a viral outbreak, The Last of Us earned a 10 from IGN, our review saying the game <q>never slows down, it never lets up, and frankly, it never disappoints.</q>
IGN also awarded The Last of Us Game of the Year for 2013. An expansion to the game, The Last of Us: Left Behind, was released to tell the story of Ellie prior to the events of the original game.
A live stream from Naughty Dog last year accidentally outed the possible existence of a second Last of Us game.
Naughty Dog also revealed a standalone chapter in the Uncharted franchise, titled Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, during the PSX showcase.</p>
